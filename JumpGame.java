/**
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

For example:
A = [2,3,1,1,4], return true.

A = [3,2,1,0,4], return false.

Answer: Simply go through all the elements one by one and record the max step can be reached
by now, if a element cannot by reached, then it is impossible to reach the last index.
