/**
You are given an integer array sorted in ascending order (may contain duplicates), you need to split them into several subsequences, where each subsequences consist of at least 3 consecutive integers. Return whether you can make such a split.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3
3, 4, 5
Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
3, 4, 5
Example 3:
Input: [1,2,3,4,4,5]
Output: False
Note:
The length of the input is in range of [1, 10000]


Hint: Use greedy solution, always attach the number to prev sequence if possible. if not, start a new sequence.
You can imagine that if the problem can be solved be both attach to previous and start a new seqence from the current number, 
start new sequence doesn't make any difference from attach the new sequence to the previous sequence.
